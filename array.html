In my opinion, the first season, the season before they discover their situation is the best.  This season has the most truly comedic scenes and overall is just more enjoyable to watch.  Every season after that continuously gets increasingly wrapped up in the plot and character development, which is nice but for a sitcom/comedy such as this I did not really love it.   Rating: 6.5/10", "The Office:  Personally, I just never really got that into this show.  Unlike some people who got super connected and still think every episode is perfect.  For me, it was just really funny.  But I laugh equal amounts watching the entire show and watching a couple youtube videos with clips from the show.  In my opinion it was super inconsistent and apart from the best moments it was totally average.  Don't get me wrong the best moments were amazingly funny but not enough to balance out the entire show.   Rating: 6/10", "Brooklyn 99: I LOVE this show.  Every single second was funny, and the characters are perfectly developed in a way that every joke they make or time they cry makes perfect sense.  Secondly, the characters work really well together, the group is a perfect blend of differences and similarities while avoiding the stereotypical office group similar to The Office.  3rd it is just really funny.  Because the main character has the same sense of humor as a 13 year old and since I watched it when I was 13, it was just really funny to me. Overall, very good show with the one downfall being the existence of Charles Boyle.   Rating: 9.7/10", "Money Heist: I really appreciate this  and how unlike many other shows I've watched it is. It gets quite dark and is very intense at almost all times.  When it is not super intense, that means you're crying tears of joy or sadness.  Sidenote: This was the first TV show that made me legitimately cry while watching it.  I think the language barrier added a special element to the show because most of the words I actually understood and did not have to read off the subtitles were curses which makes for an interesting viewing experience.  One major reason why I like this show so much is how raw it is.  It does not try to glorify crime and war incorrectly rather it shows how people react to every mistake they make and thing that goes wrong.  Finally, the only thing I do not like is the character of Monica/Stockholm.  I know characters who I find annoying are there for a reason but she is just sooo annoying, I refuse to like her.  Rating: 9.5/10", "Peaky Blinders:  This show is absolutely flawless.  Well not exactly but it feels that way most of the time.  In terms of characters, Tommy Shelby is a total badass and although as a person he has flaws you cannot help but love and feel for his character.  The rest of the Shelby family is kind of moody at times but overall there is only one semi-main character who I don't like seeing on screen.  Antagonists wise they are perfect.  None of them are made super humanized making easy to hate them while you always know their reasons and they are almost always legitimate ones. Secondly, the camerawork is immaculate, and this is one of the first shows where I have really noticed that, which just shows how good it is.  3rd, the soundtrack is amazing.  The theme song alone would be perfect but then they also use a bunch of 90s english rock and grunge which you would not think fits the theme of the show but somehow it does perfectly.  Fourth, the acting.  Paul Anderson, the actor who plays Arthur does an amazing job of portraying Arthur who has PTSD, Depression, and Severe Anxiety but he also really shows this subconcious need to please his brother Tommy which is a result of his mental state and Tommy's indimidating presence.  And then Cillian Murphy, who plays Tommy.  Well first of all, his eyes alone could win an Oscar, but then he also portrays Tommy so well and everywhere he goes he is exuding silent confidence while also knowing everything somehow.  He also expertly acts out Tommy's treatment of his wife's death and I think this is probably the best portrayal of marital grief I've ever seen in a TV Show or movie.  Fifth is the Romany aspect of the show.  All the Shelby family members are both directly descended from a Romany great-grandmother and speak fluent Romani.  First of all, I think it's really cool when they speak Romani right in front of people but like they don't understand what's going on.  Secondly, this addition strengthens the family ties of the Shelbys.  In the entire show my only problem is Arthur's wife Linda who is just an unneccessary annoyance.   Rating: 9.9/10", "The 100: This show is decidely average.  It's super action-packed, sometimes too much, but most of the time it's the correct amount.  I think the character development at times is lacking, and a comparison of any episode regulars between the end of season 1 and the beginning of the final season does not really show that much difference apart from some facial hair.  Additionally, they kill off the second most important character in the final season and not only this but he is killed by the main character with whom he is close friends.  This is terrible.  First of all, I don't really like this trope of a main character dying at the end.  Secondly, they handle it atrociously.  Her grief after having to kill him is nowhere near legitimate and the reasons for his death are nowhere in line with his character.  That being said, I think it is shockingly scientifically accurate for a sci-fi show and in the first two season, there are definitley some really enjoyable moments.  Rating: 5/10", "Downton Abbey:  So take this whole thing with a grain of salt because I finished this show many a year ago.  That being said I still remember it decently well.  One very niche aspect of this show that I really enjoy is the cars.  Similar to Peaky Blinders it's set in the 1910s and 20s meaning that Rolls-Royce's and Bentleys look absolutely amazing.  Especially because the Downton characters are so wealthy, most of the time, they own these bespoke cars with amazing interior details.  Broadly speaking, I think the characters are super well-developed with great relationships.  In a show with so many major characters and kind of two main groups, The Crawleys, and their employees, I think it is super difficult to portray the relationships between the two well, but this show does do it super well.  The only thing I have to say against it is that the characters are mostly really annoying and have weird british accents even though they are not even accents  because most of the actors are British.   Rating: 8.5/10", "The Clone Wars:  This show is actually perfect.  It is 7 seasons of pure greatness.  Even the super little details such as the way Anakin's hair gets a little longer in each season make it so much better.  One major thing that this show has going for it is the way Darth Maul is a part of it.  This show really turned him from a minor antagonist to a fan favorite with legitimate character development which I think is exactly what he deserved.  He is a part of 2 of my 5 favorite Star Wars duel ever, Maul and Savage vs Sidious and Maul vs Ashoka.  The animation style is also realy compelling to me, and unlike other animated content that I've wathced, it is not trying to be realistic while also not feeling weirdly childish which is kind of the feeling I get from most animated things I've watched.  And then of course the characters are all some of my favorite characters in fiction.  Even a side character like Hondo who only features in maybe 8 of the hundreds of episodes of the show is absolutely hilarious to watch.  His dynamic with the other characters is super fun and enjoyable, and this extends to most other characters.  And then for a character like Maul he is just an absolute badass.  His voice actors absolutely nails the raspy voice for him which is just perfect for a character such as Maul.  And then the dueling and overall fighting is some of the best in the entire Star Wars universe.  Dooku's fighting style, Form 2, which in my opinion is super elegant and visibly appealing, which is quite different from form 5 which Anakin uses, is absolutely perfectly animated and his dule against Ventress and the Nightsisters is peak television.  On a different level, there are the large scale clone battle which are what the Clone Wars are about.  Apart from Geonosis and Cristophsis we don't really see any major operations with millions of clones or multiple Jedi generals, and most of the battles that are shown are Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ashoka and the 501st.  Although I do really enjoy large scale battles, the way the 501st is portrayed makes them such an enjoyable fighting force and personable enough where you don't want any single of them to die, but soldiery enoough where they don't feel like main characters, apart from Rex and Fives.  Rating:  9.9/10", "The Great British Baking Show:  Slightly above average show.  To be fair I've only watched three seasons.  The main reason why I really don't love the show is because of Matt.  As a host I just think he's really boring, and when he does try to do his job and be funny, he fails miserably.  Everything he says or does feels forced and/or unneccessary.  Compared to Sandi, he is atrocious.  On the other hand, Sandi is essentially flawless.  Even her dynamic with Noel is so much better and more natural than Matt's.  That being said, I did watch the seasons with Sandi first so that may be impacting my opinions of the two of them.  One consistent is the judges, and broadly speaking I do like both of them.  At times, it feels like Paul can be very apathetic when critiquing compared to how he acts after someone is eliminated which frusrates me sometimes but I also recognize how difficult it is to tell someone their food is sh*t.  Rating: 7/10", "Never Have I Ever: I did actually like this show when I began, mainly season 1 and the beginning of season 2.  However as it went on, I began to enjoy it less and less.  I think the writers of the show really just tried to do to much, and incorporate lots of characters, old and new, and it really just backfired in my opinion.  Finally, I just really hate Devi.  She is way to focused on weird stuff, and always wants/needs attention which I find very annoying to watch.  So overall, it is alright.  Rating: 4/10", "Superstore: This show is a beauty.  All the characters are amazing, well-developed, and lovable ones.  Every relationship that you think should be endgame works out, most of them.  Also, it's just really really funny.  No matter what your sense of humor is, you will find this show funny.  Of the main characters they are all very different people with very different senses of humor.  There's dry humor, sarcasm, slapstick, dark humor, and even some Family Guy-esc offensive humor, sometimes.  I think also one reason I really like this show is because there are no major changes throughout the entire show.  Sure some main characters leave and come back and some new characters join, but no massive shakeups that truly throw off the dynamic of the whole show. Most episodes are somewhat routine and it's just a nice show to watch for a really long time.  Rating: 7.5/10", "The Flash:  This show has a lot of ups and downs and the only accurate way to describe it is inconsistent.  Season 1-3 are undeniably really good.  Season 4, I personally really like but most people don't.  It is a consesus agreement that seasons 5-7 are not good.  Season 8 started off really strong but got a little worse with each episode.  Season 1-3 stick to the basics.  Each episode has one minor villain an one advancement or setback in the fight against the major villain who is also a speedster.  Aditionally, the team stays very tight it is just Barry, Caitlin, Cisco and the Wells of the season.  In these three seasons the plot stays simple enough but interesting and the CGI is still really high-quality.  This begins to change in season 4 when a couple new people join the team and the main villain of the season is some science guy who created some weird superpower for himself.  This is why generally season 4 is not liked but I think it is still alright because the CGI is still good and Barry is not completely cringey yet.  Seasons 5-7 unfortunately go completely off the rails.  The show had always included fake science reasoning for people not dying, or coming back to life, or how to defeat a villian but it goes to a whole other level after season 4.  Also, the CGI somehow gets worse over time, as even the effects of Barry running look less legitimate.  There are also just some weird muddled plot lines and villains that just make it hard to watch.  One thing that is good about these seasons is that they include the best crossover episodes.  Season 5 has Elsewords and Season 6 has Crisis both of which are 2 of the 3 best crossover arcs.  Now season 8 also starts with a minor crossover, where a couple random heroes work with Barry, but the crossing over is limited because Oliver's dead, Supergirl is cancelled, and Batwoman is irrelevant. That being said it is still a really high quality five episodes that include Eobard Thawne, and whenever he is a part of the show the show automatically is better.  For the remaining episodes of the season, Eobard is still the main villain which is good, but the fake science goes absolutely crazy.  Somehow when dead dust from Iris is infused into a good version of Eobard he turns back into the evil one, which at this point is just so absurd.  Overall, the show is solid mainly because of seasons 1-3.  Rating: 7/10 ", "Arrow:  Similar to other shows in the Arrowverse, Arrow is super inconsistent.  Seasons 1-3 are amazing.  Season 4 is a bit of step back.  Season 5 is without the best season in the entire show.  Seasons 6 and 7 are debated but overall I like them.  Season 8 is kind of annoying but pretty good because it provides good closure.  So seasons 1-3 are really good in my opinion because of the island flashbacks.  The parallel of Oliver being introduced to Lian Yu, to Yao Fei, to Slade, and him learning the basis of all of his fighting techniques and Oliver using all these techniques and this knowledge as he reintegrates into 'normal' society while also being the Arrow and maintaining that part of himself that he developed during those five years. Aditionally, for season 2 specifically while he is fighting Slade, every new flashback reveals relevant information about the present and Slade's motivations. One minor thing that is sometiems frustrating about these seasons is how few people know about Oliver being the Arrow which really just wastes screen time with like Thea, his mom, and for a little bit, Felicity.  Another good thing about these seasons though is how disconnected from the political and social side of things the team is.  He never really has issues with everyone learning who he is, or him being targeted by the police, or his killings being caught and prosecuted.  Season 4 moves away from this structure slightly in 3 major ways.  First, the Arrow becomes more socially involved as Oliver runs for mayor which causes a few minor issues.  Second is the introduction of real magic.  Throughout seasons 1-3 there was fake science, there was the multiverse, and there was time travel, and most of this was only connected to Arrow through the Flash, and that was all fine and good.  But magic is a new thing and unlike most other heroes, Oliver does not have superpower so it makes it kind of weird.  Third is that the flashbacks are not as good.  They are much slower with less development, and although they are directly connected to the main villain of the season, less interesting stuff goes on in them.  Now season 5 is just a work of art.  First of all, the villain is the best villain in the entire series in my opinion and he impacts Oliver the most.  He gets Oliver to quit being the Arrow twice in like 6 episodes and at the same time is using his real identity to get close to Oliver.  Second the way they reconstruct/recreate is almost impeccable.  With the end of season 4, two major characters left the team and another major character died.  Even with this, 5 major characters joined the team, and although one was evil and one left, they still remade the team really effectively.  This season is also the one with the most internal conflict for Oliver and seeing how it impacts his relationships, and his work as both the Arrow and the mayor is really interesting to watch.  Finally, the fighting is just peak television.  The main villain was trained by the same woman who trained Oliver meaning that they are evenly matched.  However, Prometheus is always a million steps ahead of him which makes Oliver always at a disadvantage.  Aditionally, working with a new team is at first uncomfortable for Oliver but has the seaosn goes on they fight better and better side by side.  Now season 6 and 7 are kind of mid but I also kind of like them.  The 'major' villain of season 6 and partially 7 is a really chill dude but he's also kind of a terrible guy so I don't really have a real opinion on him.  In season 6 though, Oliver has some amazing fight scenes in prison and when he reconnects with Talia.  Season 7 there is a major plot twist when Oliver learns he has a half sister who of course turns out to be evil.  I don't really like that bit, and it feels like the showwriters are trying to do to much.  Season 8 is also a weird one because the entire season is leading up to Crisis and Oliver's eventual sacrifice.  This means there is a lot of time travel and weird interactions with his children who grew up without him, although his children as adults are actually really good characters.  We also get lots and lots of emotional heart to hearts with various characters throughout the season and although it is kind of sappy it's a really nice way to close the show.  Rating: 9/10"]
