<h1>Journal</h1>

<h2>Journal Entry 1 - 10-1-22</h2>
<p> So far, I've just been learning the basics of HTML, and a little bit of CSS.  More specifically, I've learned how to make DIVs, how to style them, and how to add in transitions when the mouse hovers over them.  On the 2nd day of class, I made a pretty cool page with 21 individual DIVs so that when you move your mouse across the screen from right to left, down, left to right, down, right to left, it brings up a pretty cool, abstract rainbow with a mix of shapes and sizes.  It's super rewarding to finish a mini-project, especially, if like this one, there were some <strong>major</strong> struggles along the way.  The same can be said for when I was working on my Picture Card, because I made some really minor errors that rendered it completely dysfunctional until I <strong>finally</strong> found the errors and fixed them.  I also kind of struggled when I was using the Terminal for the first time, just because the syntax was a bit hard to understand for me. Overall, I have really enjoyed what I've been doing so far.</p>
