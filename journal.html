<h1>Kavi's CS1 Journal</h1>


<h2>Journal Entry 1 - 10-1-22</h2>
<p> So far, I've just been learning the basics of HTML, and a little bit of CSS.  More specifically, I've learned how to make DIVs, how to style them, and how to add in transitions when the mouse hovers over them.  On the 2nd day of class, I made a pretty cool page with 21 individual DIVs so that when you move your mouse across the screen from right to left, down, left to right, down, right to left, it brings up a pretty cool, abstract rainbow with a mix of shapes and sizes.  It's super rewarding to finish a mini-project, especially, if like this one, there were some <strong>major</strong> struggles along the way.  The same can be said for when I was working on my Picture Card, because I made some really minor errors that rendered it completely dysfunctional until I <strong>finally</strong> found the errors and fixed them.  I also kind of struggled when I was using the Terminal for the first time, just because the syntax was a bit hard to understand for me. Overall, I have really enjoyed what I've been doing so far.</p>

<h2>Journal Entry 2 - 10-9-22</h2>
<p>I have been continuing to add to my website, and while doing so, I figured out how to add a  background  that I liked, this cool color scheme, and I chose a different background color for this journal. I also have definitely gotten much more comfortable in terms of navigating the terminal; I think the cheat sheet was a very helpful resource to becoming more confident using terminal and coding the website as a whole. I am looking forward to creating more fun projects to add to my website.

<h2>Journal Entry 3 - 10-15-22</h2>
<p>So, I started doing some animation stuff.  For the most part I was just messing around seeing what worked and what did not.  For me, the changing color stuff, and hovering to activate the animation, I was able to do pretty well.  I am also pretty comfortable changing the amount of times the animation runs, and the sequence in which in runs, so like reversed or straight forward.  The one big thing that frankly, I just did not get at all was the movement part, which I know is kind of the biggest part in terms of animation.  I tried a bunch of different stuff, it just never worked.  I'm almost one hundred percent sure that there was one stupid mistake I was making throughout the whole thing which was why it was not working.  Overall, I think I need some help.
